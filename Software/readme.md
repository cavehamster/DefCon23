# Software

Here you will find some example code to get you up and running with your badge.

There are two different microcontrollers on the badge, and as such, two different subdirectories.

[Parallax Propeller](./Propeller)
[Atmel AVR](./AVR)

Also see the [Programming Notes](../programmingnotes.md)
