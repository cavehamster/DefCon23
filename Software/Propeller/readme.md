# Parallax Propeller

The main processor on your badge is the Parallax Propeller.  It's a cute little 8 core 32 bit microcontroller.

The code here was written in C using the [Parallax SimpleIDE](http://learn.parallax.com/propeller-c-set-simpleide).  Parallax also has a great tutorial there in getting started.

Why C?  The Propeller was designed for a special programming language called Spin, but I just like programming in C a little better.  Fortunately, there is a nice GCC for the Propeller that abstracts most of the strangeness of the Propeller from you and you can just get down and dirty with code.
